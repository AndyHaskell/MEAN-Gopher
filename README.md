# MEAN Gopher
### Web development in Go for MEAN Stack developers

## What is MEAN Gopher?

MEAN Gopher is a series of gopher-sized tutorials on learning various techniques, skills, and packages for web development in Go from Node.js.

It's mainly for people with some Go experience who are learning web development in Go from a MEAN Stack background (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node), but since the Node examples are just there for comparison with the Go examples, Node experience isn't required.
